# NewsFeedApp
This is an android app showing latest news. It uses Retrofit to interact with an API from newsapi.org.

To install and run the app, i have exported it to the .apk file. ( app/release/app-release.apk )

I used Android Studio to create this project. Source code is written in Java and frontend in Android XML.
